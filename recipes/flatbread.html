      <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Add the butter if using and mix well.</li>
        <li>Gradually stir in the water until a smooth dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough briefly, then divide into 6–8 equal balls.</li>
        <li>Roll each ball into a very thin circle (the thinner, the crispier).</li>
        <li>Cook on a dry skillet or griddle over medium heat for 1–2 minutes on each side, until lightly browned and crisp.</li>
        <li>Cool completely before storing. Serve plain or with toppings like smoked fish, butter, or cheese.</li>
